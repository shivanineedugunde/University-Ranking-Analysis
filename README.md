University Ranking Analysis

This project presents an interactive data visualization and analysis of the QS World University Rankings 2024, exploring key metrics such as institutional performance, country-wise distribution, student population size, age bands, and academic focus areas.

Through a visually engaging Power BI dashboard, the project uncovers insights into the global higher education landscape, helping stakeholders understand trends and performance at a glance.

📌 Project Overview
This analysis focuses on:

Understanding university performance across countries and institutions.

Comparing university metrics such as student size, age, and academic focus.

Visualizing average overall scores geographically and categorically.

📊 Key Visualizations
1. Average Score by Institution
Displays the average Overall Score of top institutions in a selected country.

A filter is applied for country-specific exploration.

2. University Count by Country
Tree map showing the number of universities considered per country in the QS ranking dataset.

Larger blocks represent countries with higher representation.

3. University Count by Size & Age
Bar chart categorizing universities by student population size (S, M, L, XL) and age band (1-5).

Age Band:

1 = Newest

5 = Oldest

4. Average Score by Focus Area
Visual comparison of overall scores based on university focus:

FC = Full Curriculum

CO = Comprehensive

FO = Focused

SP = Specialized

5. Geographical Score Distribution
Bubble map showing average overall score per country.

Bubble size represents the relative score, offering a global performance perspective.
